# Chicago Food Inspections â€“ Data Science Project

This project analyzes a dataset of food facility inspections in the city of Chicago.  
It covers the full pipeline from **data cleaning**, **exploratory analysis**, **visualizations**, and a **machine learning model** to predict inspection outcomes.

## ðŸ“Š Key Features
- Cleaned and processed over 200,000 records
- Explored risk levels, violation patterns, facility types, and location-based trends
- Built a classification model (XGBoost) with ~84% accuracy
- Visualized inspection failure hotspots using heatmaps and bar charts

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- XGBoost
- Google Colab Notebook

## ðŸ¤– Model Insights
The XGBoost classifier uses facility metadata to predict whether an inspection will result in **Fail** or **Pass** based on risk level, type, ZIP code, and violation history.
